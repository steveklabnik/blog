No, seriously. This is a public service announcment to all MBAs who want to do
startups: 'platform' does not mean 'web site.'

I know that 'platform' is a hot thing right now. But seriously, the term has
become basically useless. It's almost to the point that I just pretend you
don't even say it.

A platform is primarily a B2B play. It can be B2C too, maybe, but largely, to
have a platform, you need to enable other people to build something.
Usually, that's another business. But if your website does not enable
others to build something, or you're not white labeling it in some way,
you're not a platform.

A platform basically needs an API. APIs are the primary way that two pieces of
software connect to one another. If your web service doesn't have an API, it's
not a platform. White labeling being an exception.

I'd make this rant longer, but I really need a good platform that addresses my
market segment. Ideally, it'll enable some win-win synergies with other
channel partner and grow the pie for both of us. Until then, I really won't find
a good solution for this real pain I feel as a content producer.
