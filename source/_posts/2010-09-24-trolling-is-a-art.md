I find it incredibly hard not to be judgmental.

I'm not sure what part of my personality makes this happen, but even
when I try to curb tearing down other people, I end up doing it
anyway. I'm not sure if it's just me, but I think part of the problem
is that these kinds of things are rewarded.

This is me, being a jerk.

One of the reasons that I use my real name everywhere is to try to
improve the civility of my discourse. When you're anonymous, it's
really easy to be callous. And when I used a handle, I was even worse.
But even now, I can think of three times when I accidentally was mean
for basically no reason: That tweet, the Diaspora incident, and the
only Hacker News comment I've ever deleted.

In all three of these instances, it's not so much that I was wrong.
It's that I ended up presenting my criticisms poorly. I think I did a
decent job with the Diaspora one, but people still took it the wrong
way, so I failed to communicate. I'm certainly not infallible. I
guarantee you there are n00b errors and security holes in my own
codebases. So I really shouldn't be so quick to judge.
That's all I have to say about that. I'll just have to do better going
forward.
