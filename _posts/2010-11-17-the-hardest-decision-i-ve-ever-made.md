title: The hardest decision I've ever made.

I'll cut to the chase: I've stepped down as CTO of CloudFab. I don't
want to discuss details, but life is too short to not be doing what
you want with it. And, after a period of careful thought and
consideration, it's no longer the right thing for me. It was an
amicable parting, and my replacements are already in place, and doing
cool things. I'm happy with what I've accomplished, but it's time  for me to
move on.

This raises the question: what am I moving on to? Here's the answer:
Hackety Hack. What I truly care about is teaching, writing, and
discussing software. If I could do anything, I'd hack on Hackety,
share what I know with others, and keep learning and playing with new
things all day long.

However, there's a certain question of sustainability here: I'm not
made of money, and I have lots of bills to pay. However, doing the
'obvious' thing would be really, truly wrong: Hackety Hack is not and
will never be a startup. It's a social venture, if anything: it would
be absolutely unquestioningly wrong for me to ever ask anyone for a
single cent for it. It'd also be counterproductive: how could I share
programming with everyone if I excluded those without disposable
income?

So to this end, Hackety cannot be all that I do. And while I really
want to teach, I also have a lot to learn. Luckily, I have some great
allies in this area: I've been working alongside two teachers at the
University of Pittsburgh over the past month or so: one in the English
department, and one in the Computer Science department. In doing so,
I've come to realize that my place in life is actually in the middle:
while I love the theoretical side of CS, I'm actually much more
interested in the application. And teachers need to be effective
communicators, so investing in writing is absolutely worthwhile for
me. At the same time, I've really enjoyed every chance I've had to
write: there's a reason I keep three blogs now! I'm also incredibly
interested in the parallels that exist between computer and human
languages. I like the comparison between refactoring and composition.
I think the two fields have a lot to learn from one another. It's
something I'd like to explore more.

To do so, I'll have to finish off my undergrad degree. Luckily, I'm
very close, so I'll be doing that in the spring. Afterward, it's my
intention to go to grad school in the English department, so I'm
furiously working on my application, with the help of the
aforementioned teacher. At the same time, I'll possibly help teach or
TA classes in the CS department as well. I'm hoping to combine my
solid foundations in the hard sciences with the new perspective and
improved analysis that the humanities can offer.

I don't think that academia is where I want to stay forever, but I
think it's a good place for me to grow for now. It's time for me to
invest in myself a little. I think I'll end up a much better person in
the end.
