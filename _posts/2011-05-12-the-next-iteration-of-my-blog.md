title: The next iteration of my blog

Well well well, some things never change. Long ago, I hosted my own
blog, and here we are again. I've moved everything over to Jekyll, if
that means anything to you. You can now [look at my blog on
GitHub](https://github.com/steveklabnik/blog).

## New-ish beginnings

So why'd I do this? Well, this is just part of moving more towards
hosting all of my own services, and not relying on services that others
provide. This isn't some sort of arugment over individualism vs.
collectivism, it's more about [No More Sharecropping](http://nomoresharecropping.org/).

I'm still relying on people for hosting, of course. Nobody is 100%
removed, but with my own backup of everything, I'm in total control
here. It's really minimal work to keep this going, and only a few hours
of setup to move everything over.

## A small change in focus, too

I'm also going to stop bitching about politics so often, and try to be
more constructive in general. I have a lot to say about this new
humanities angle that my life has taken as of late. Hence, I've changed
the title of my blog. And you can expect more posts along those lines.
More about books, more about art and code, less whining. One may think
I'm maturing or something...
