TL;DR:

```
WANTED: Proletarian/petite bourgeoisie looking for
capitalist/industrialist/haute bourgeoisie. I've got the labor power, you've
got the money commodity. Let's exchange commodities at full market value in
accordance with the Law of Value; I know you'll extract some surplus and
alienate my species-being, but I really need to regenerate and reproduce myself
so that I can be around to labor tomorrow.
```

Yes, that's right, I am officially looking for work. I loved my job at
[Jumpstart Lab](http://jumpstartlab.com), but all good things must come to an
end. So here we are. There's a [farewell
post](http://jumpstartlab.com/news/archives/2013/10/01/a-fond-farewell) on the
JSL blog too.

So, what's next? To be honest, I'm not fully sure. I'm open to suggestions, and
I give bonus points for interesting.

Things I want out of life:

1. Travel. I still like doing this.
2. Related: some degree of location independence. I'll only accept positions
that require me to be in a seat that's in San Fransisco and New York City.
Remote would be even better. Probably.
3. Piles of money. I have student loan debt I'd prefer not to have.
4. Side project ability. I am highly motivated by doing side projects that are
different than I do all day.

... I'm not saying that Ruby is a minus, but I'm not saying it's a plus,
either.

So, if you think we might work well together, please, [send me an
email](mailto:steve@steveklabnik.com).
