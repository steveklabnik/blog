Every year I try to do a "year in Review" blog post, and every year I realize I
didn't keep good notes. Sigh.

Overall, this was a pretty... meh year, to be honest. :/ Don't get me wrong, a
lot of really, really good things happened, but as far as my grand strategic
life goals go, this year was pretty much treading water, and in some cases,
regressive. Oh well.

So instead of doing as much of a review, I'm going to instead discuss what
I'd like 2014 to be like:

### Better tracking

In general, I don't think I accomplished all I wanted to because I didn't measure
it at all. I've found that [Beeminder](http://beeminder.com) has helped me track
one or two of the things that I've really wanted to accomplish, and so I plan on
making lots of use of that. It's not perfect for everything, but it helps.

### Reading

I have so much I need to read. I think I'm going to start by recording chapters
in Beeminder; books are too granular. I don't think that a book every two weeks
is an unreasonable goal, and I may turn it up if I get in the swing of things.

### Writing

I really need to finish off the hypermedia book, and the Rails 4 in Action book.
R4IA should be easy, the hypermedia book will be harder.

### Software

I want to contribute to Tor this year.  I've been putting off contributing to
Tor due to my paranoia about NSA stuff, but really, at this point, there's
nothing to worry about. I'm probably on all of those lists anyway. They're
watching everyone.

In order to do that, I need to up my crypto game. I'd like to finish off the
Matasano Crypto Challenge, and read a bunch more things.

I also want to make lots of contributions to Rust this year, if not the language
itself, the ecosystem. There's so much work to be done.

### Body

I've been trying to stay relatively fit, and it's been okay, but I really need
to get back on that train. I got a copy of "Starting Strength" for Christmas.

### Languages

I'm consistently embarassed that I only speak one language. I've been working on
some German, and it's been okay, but I need to take it more seriously. I'd also
like to pick up the basic Japanese I had before.


### Conclusion

I think that's it, at least for now. Let's hope this next year is a good one.
