I sent out an email today to everyone who'd previously purchased [Designing Hypermedia APIs](http://www.designinghypermediaapis.com/). Here's
the text:

```
Hey there,

First of all, I want to apologize for sending you an email. I try to
keep these to a minimum. But this one is important.

I haven't been uploading new content lately for a few reasons.
Holidays are complicated, I wasn't feeling inspired... but this is the
real reason: I've totally moved the site to something different. I
just updated it, so the DNS might need an update, but
http://www.designinghypermediaapis.com/ is all-new. Here's the deal:

1. Gone is logging in and reading it online. PDF/ePUB/MOBI now.
2. Because you purchased a copy before, you get the big bundle. Thank
you for your support over the last year.
3. You'll be getting another email with a link to download the files.
When I send an update, you'll get a new email with a new link.
4. The current written content is basically an appendix: I'm going to
be writing a more traditional book, from start to finish. It'll walk
you through building an application, both client and server.
5. I want this to be of the highest quality, so I'm not going to
commit to a schedule.

If you aren't a part of the mailing list, we're doing a reading club
over the next few months, "Building Hypermedia APIs with HTML5 and
Node." You can join by emailing hypermedia@librelist.com.

Thank you once again for your support of this project, I really
appreciate it. As always, any and all feedback welcome: I bet I can do
some nicer formatting of the PDF/ePUB/MOBI now that I have them
generating.
```

Wooo!
