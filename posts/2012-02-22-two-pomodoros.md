title: Two Pomodoros
---

I'd been thinking about doing this for a while, and yesterday, actually got
around to it. The basic idea is this: record me during normal development, and
then post it to the internet.

Here's the video:

## Why this is interesting

Why is this interesting at all? Well, there are a few things:

### Exposing myself is hard

It's really difficult to put myself out there in this way. I thought about it
two or three times, then recorded myself and threw it away two or three times,
then finally published this version.

It's primarily difficult because I'm nowhere near perfect. For example:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-in-reply-to="172124830227902464" width="350"><p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/steveklabnik">steveklabnik</a> I mean I love vim, you were just using it cringe-inducingly</p>&mdash; Dannel Jurado (@DeMarko) <a href="https://twitter.com/DeMarko/status/172125229462724610" data-datetime="2012-02-22T01:07:07+00:00">February 22, 2012</a></blockquote>

There are lots of things that I can improve upon in my workflow, and vim is **certainly** one of them. So showing everyone that I suck at vim is rough, but it also lead to several improvements. Some people gave me a few good .vimrc suggestions, and some shortcuts I should focus on. So it's positive, for sure, but that doesn't make it difficult.

### Destroying celebrity

I am incredibly uncomfortable with referring to myself as anything more than an
above-average developer. Maybe expert, sure. The thing to remember about your
programming heroes is that they're just people, too. They aren't demi-gods.
They don't have a super-secret sauce that you don't have access to.

So by putting out a video that shows my flaws, those who think I'm super awesome
will maybe think of me as just like them, rather than someone particularly special.

### This is the Real World

Too often things like blog posts present a fake, clean-room environment to
demonstrate their ideas. "See, testing is absolutely easy, let me go through
this example that I've specially crafted to demonstrate how easy it is!"

This isn't the case with this video. It's the real deal. Watch towards the end as
I stupidly don't realize that the test code I replaced was different than what
I replaced it with. Heh.

### Everything becomes conscious

Knowing you're being watched has a crazy effect on you. I accidentally checked
Twitter once during a test run, and immediately went "ZOMG POMODOROS PEOPLE ARE
WATCHING ASSHOLE YOU SCREWED UP!!!!1" Whenever I mis-typed something in vim,
"OMG YOU DON"T KNOW THAT SHORTCUT? EVERYONE ON THE INTERNET THINKS YOU"RE
STUPID!"

As long as I can keep this effect real, I'll be hyper-aware of where my flaws
are. That's kinda neat in and of itself.

## What do you think?

Is this interesting? Should I keep doing this from time to time? What about an
actual real LiveStream, not just recordings later?
