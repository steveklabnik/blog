Today, I released Draper 1.0.0! Draper is a gem that gives you decorators/view
models for Rails.

* Rubygems: https://rubygems.org/gems/draper
* GitHub: https://github.com/drapergem/draper
* README: https://github.com/drapergem/draper/blob/master/README.md

You can get it with Rubygems:

```
$ gem install draper
```

or by adding this to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "draper", "~>1.0.0"
```

Draper supports all versions of Rails 3, and follows
[SemVer](http://semver.org/), so you can be confident that your application
will work well with Draper in the future. Thank you to everyone who tried out
our six (six!!!11) beta releases and gave us patches and feedback.
