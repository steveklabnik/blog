title: Matz is Nice So We Are Nice
layout: post
---

Rubyists have a saying, or at least, we used to. "Matz is nice so we are
nice." This has sort of been lost over the years... some people who have
been around Ruby for a long time still say this, but it's something
that's gone in and out of popularity.

## Nice should be the default

Most of being nice, in a software context, is about being considerate.
Not unnecessarily trash talking other people's stuff. Not going out of
your way to be a jerk. Try to be helpful. Treat others how you want to
be treated.

## Sometimes, the truth hurts

Being considerate of others, however, can only go so far. While a lot of
what we do is subjective, a lot of is objective, too. If you're building
a new project, not saying "this is why we're awesome" is silly. Old code
is often bad. Other people's code is often bad. The key in "not
unnecessarily trash talking' is the _neccesary_ part. There's a
difference between "My library is better" and "My library is better and
their library sucks."

## The last thing I'll say about RVM Drama

After talking to a few people, I guess I committed a bit of the sin I
was trying to rail against: I got some feedback that it was thought that
I was villainizing Sam, and a little easy on Wayne. This is natural,
because I'm friends with Wayne and I don't really know Sam, but in the
interest of being nice myself, I just want to say this: I think that all
that drama last week was largely a perfect storm of a few different
factors, and I don't think that Sam set out to hurt anyone specifically.
If and when I ever have an issue with RVM, I'm totally going to try out
rbenv. I like having options. I like there being multiple options.
TMTOWTDI. And Sam builds a ton of other software that I really enjoy,
like Sprockets, and pow. There's a big difference between "that guy is
an asshole" and "I think that that situation could have been handled
better."

Let's all build lots of cool software together.
