I'm so very close to releasing the beta of [Get Some REST](http://designinghypermediaapis.com/). 
However, I'm about to get on a plane to Poland, and that's a bad time to launch
things. ;) [wroc\_love.rb](http://wrocloverb.com/), here I come!

Anyway, I figured I'd give you a preview of some of the content that I've been
working on. This particular article is short, but it's also a public response
to something, and so, to whet your appetite, I figured I'd give you a little
taste of what's to come. It's out of context, so I'm a little light on
explaining why you'd do each step of the process; there is much more on that
elsewhere in the book! Rather than explaing all the _why_, I just actually do
it. This is one of the last articles, and it's a fairly simple example once
you've grokked all the fundamentals, so it's a bit small, lengthwise.

If all goes well, I'll be releasing at wroc\_love.rb. So keep your eyes peeled.

Without further ado, the article.

Rob Conery is a pretty cool guy. While I always enjoy reading <a href="http://blog.wekeroad.com/">his blog</a>, he's
been at battle with the Hypermedia crowd recently. It's always good natured,
though, and he means well.

He recently posed <a href="http://wekeroad.com/2012/03/03/moving-the-philosophy-into-machinery/">an interesting question to his blog</a>:

> I would like to invite the good people who have engaged with me over the last
> few days to jump in and write me up an API – and by way of explanation – show
> how their ideas can be translated into reality.

Great! After all, social exchange is one of the building blocks of society:

> In so far as the process of exchange transfers commodities from hands in
> which they are non-use-values to hands in which they are use-values, it is a
> process of social metabolism.

Let's apply what we've learned about the basics of designing
hypermedia APIs. Here are his requirements:

## Use Cases

This is step one: simple authentication and then consumption of basic data. The client will be HTML, JS, and Mobile.

### Logging In

Customer comes to the app and logs in with email and password. A token is returned by the server upon successful authentication and a message is also received (like “thanks for logging in”).

### Productions

Joe User is logged in and wants to see what he can watch. He chooses to browse all productions and can see in[sic] the app which ones he is allowed to watch and which ones he isn’t. He then chooses to narrow his selection by category: Microsoft, Ruby, Javascript, Mobile. Once a production is selected, a list of Episodes is displayed with summary information. Joe wants to view Episode 2 of Real World ASP.NET MVC3 – so he selects it. The video starts.

### Episodes.

Kelly User watches our stuff on her way to work every day, and when she gets on the train [sic] will check and see if we’ve pushed any new episodes recently. A list of 5 episodes comes up – she chooses one, and watches it on her commute.


## The design process

### Step 1: Evaluate Process

Fortunately, this has been done for us, in the Use Cases above. Sweet!

### Step 2: Create state machine

Taking all of this into account, I drew out this state machine:

![tekpub state machine](/images/tekpub_state_machine.png)

Basically, you start at a root. Two options: see the newest list of
productions, or see them all. You can filter all of them by a category.
Eventually, you end up picking one. This workflow should be enough to support
all of our use cases.

### Step 3: Evaluate Media Type

Okay, so, he mentions this in use cases:

> The client will be HTML, JS, and Mobile.

I'm not 100% sure what he means here: I think it's that we'll be building a
site on this API (html), it'll have heavy JS usage (js), and probably a mobile
version or possibly a native client (mobile).

Given this information, I'm going to choose JSON as a base format. Besides,
our developers tend to like it. ;)

After that choice is made, we also need these things:

- Filtering things means a templated query of some kind, so we'll need some
  kind of templating syntax.
- We need lists of things as well as singular things. I like to simply this by
  representing singular things as a list of one item. So, lists and individual
  items.
- We also have a few attributes we need to infer from these loose requirements.
  No biggie. :)

### Step 4: Create Media Types

Based on this, I've made up [the application/vnd.tekpub.productions+json media type](/tekpub-productions.html). Key features, based on our evaluation:

- Each transition in our state machine has a relation attribute
- Each transition that needs to be parameterized has some sort of template
  syntax
- Each attribute that we need someone to know about has a definition
- Everything is always a list. It may contain just one item. Our client's
  interface can detect this special case and display something different if it
  wants.

### Step 5: Implementation!

That's for Rob! ahaha!

However, you might want a sample implementation. I'm willing to make one if
there's confusion about it, but I figured I'd put the article out and see if
that's interesting to people before I went through the effort.

## What about auth?

Oh, I didn't handle the auth case. That's because auth happens at the HTTP
level, not at the application level. HTTP BASIC + SSL or Digest should be just
fine.

## But, but, but... I didn't get any verbs! Or URLS!

I know. Fielding:

> A REST API should spend almost all of its descriptive effort in defining the
> media type(s) used for representing resources and driving application state,
> or in defining extended relation names and/or hypertext-enabled mark-up for
> existing standard media types. Any effort spent describing what methods to
> use on what URIs of interest should be entirely defined within the scope of
> the processing rules for a media type (and, in most cases, already defined by
> existing media types). [Failure here implies that out-of-band information is
> driving interaction instead of hypertext.]

As well as

> A REST API must not define fixed resource names or hierarchies (an obvious
> coupling of client and server). Servers must have the freedom to control
> their own namespace. Instead, allow servers to instruct clients on how to
> construct appropriate URIs, such as is done in HTML forms and URI templates,
> by defining those instructions within media types and link relations.
> [Failure here implies that clients are assuming a resource structure due to
> out-of band information, such as a domain-specific standard, which is the
> data-oriented equivalent to RPC's functional coupling].

And 

> A REST API should be entered with no prior knowledge beyond the initial URI
> (bookmark) and set of standardized media types that are appropriate for the
> intended audience (i.e., expected to be understood by any client that might
> use the API). From that point on, all application state transitions must be
> driven by client selection of server-provided choices that are present in the
> received representations or implied by the user’s manipulation of those
> representations. The transitions may be determined (or limited by) the
> client’s knowledge of media types and resource communication mechanisms, both
> of which may be improved on-the-fly (e.g., code-on-demand). [Failure here
> implies that out-of-band information is driving interaction instead of
> hypertext.]

Soooooooooo yeah.
