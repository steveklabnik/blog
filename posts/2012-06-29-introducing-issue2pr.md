Ever had an issue on GitHub, and then you fixed the bug? Opened a brand new 
pull request, which becomes a new issue, and then you have to remember to link
the two via a comment, or manually go back and close the issue as well?

Turns out that GitHub has the power to turn Issues into Pull Requests in the
API, but not in the web UI. So I wrote a tiny web app that lets you use the
API call yourself: [http://issue2pr.herokuapp.com/](http://issue2pr.herokuapp.com/)

Of course, the code is up on GitHub, here: [https://github.com/steveklabnik/issue2pr](https://github.com/steveklabnik/issue2pr)

Issues (and pull requests) welcome!
