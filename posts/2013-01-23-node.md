Soooo there's this thing:
[http://harthur.wordpress.com/2013/01/24/771/](http://harthur.wordpress.com/2013/01/24/771/)

First of all, unequivocably, I said it before, and I'll say it again: I'm
sorry, and feel terrible that I made someone feel terrible. @harthur, I felt
bad yesterday, and I'm feeling bad again. Not that it helps you feel bad. But
I don't like making other people feel bad. I am sorry.

## tl;dr

TL;DR: I am sorry. I feel terrible that I made someone else feel terrible. I
feel even worse because I didn't mean to say that they were terrible, but
accidentally did.


# the why

Sooooooo I wrote up _why_ I said what it was that I said, because what I was
trying to say was totally unrelated to `replace`. I was trying to explain why
I don't like Node, and it basically came out wrong. But, explaining what I said
had the affect of feeling like I was trying not to apologize. So, I'll just
cut to the chase and say this, cut straight from the chat log:

    SK: i dont want people to think i'm saying "i got caught being an asshole so i'm saying sorry"
    SK: i want to say "I was accidentally being an asshole so i'm sorry"

So, I'll just leave it at that. Twitter makes it so hard not to accidentally
be an asshole.
