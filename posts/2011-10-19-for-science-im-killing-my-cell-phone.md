Yep. Doin' it. This morning I swung by the Sprint store and picked up a 4G
hotspot. Gonna transfer my number to Google Voice this evening.

## lolwhut?

Yep. I'm terribly addicted to my phone right now. This is fine, but I'm
always interested in improving myself. I have a few friends who've done
similar things, and really enjoyed it. So I'm giving it a solid 6 months.
Sometimes, experiments work, and sometimes they don't. I'm doing this
for fun more than anything, and so it might not work out. Google Maps is
damn handy.

## So I can't call you?

Naw, it just means there might be a tad more latency. I'm on my computer all
the effing time anyway, so I doubt that you'll really notice. If someone
calls when I'm not at my computer, Google will just take a recording and
email me the transcript. No biggie.

## Yeah, well, have fun with that!

I will. And I'll keep you all posted on how it goes. I plan to do a
retrospective monthly.

EDIT: I had to change my number because Google Voice wouldn't transfer my old
one. So get a hold of me some other way, and I'll give you the new one.
