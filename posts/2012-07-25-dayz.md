I've recently come across one of the most addicting, interesting experiences
I've ever had online: [DayZ](http://dayzmod.com/). I hesitate to call it a
'video game,' because while it is a mod for a first person shooter game, it
basically ignores all common wisdom about what makes for a good game. I think
that the broader implications are also interesting across other domains:
'common wisdom' isn't always correct. Sometimes communities reach local
maximums, and something drastic needs to be done to break out of the rut. So
what is DayZ, anyway?

Essentially, DayZ is a simulation of a zombie apocalypse. Here's a screenshot:

As you can see, there's basically no HUD. Just some indicators down at the
bottom. This particular shot is in the third person mode, which I prefer, and
the player is looking over their left shoulder at a zombie shambling around
on the crest of the hill.

You wake up on a beach with essentially nothing in your pockets. This means
that you have no way to defend yourself, and no supplies. Check out the bottom
right of that screenshot: See that canteen and knife and fork? Those are water
and food indicators, and if you don't eat or drink often enough, you'll faint
from fatigue, and even lose blood (which is a proxy for health, and is the
middle indicator). So you have to sneak around until you can find a hatchet,
food, and water. See those two things on the upper right? That's how much audio
and visual 'noise' you give off. Right now, this player is basically invisible,
so they're safe.

The game takes realism very seriously. There's the food and water bit, but this
also isn't some Left 4 Dead run and gun bullshit: if you take damage, you'll
start to bleed, and will need to bandage yourself or bleed out. If you get
shot, you're basically dead. You _might_ be able to take two bullets from small
arms. I already mentioned the food and water. You can break bones, which
seriously limits mobility, and will probably cause the shakes. Better take some
painkillers! There are a few vehicles, but they're all in disrepair, so find
some parts, fix them up, and then stop and put some gas in them! Voice chat
only works for a 40 yard radius around where you stand, so you can't talk to
people that are far away. You don't have a map at first, so you won't know
where the hell you are until you find one. Of course, you can read the street
signs, so obviously, you'll know when you're in черногорск. ;). (That's
'Cherno' as it's affectionately called by players, because 'Chernogorsk' is too
long to say.) Oh, and when you die, you die. You lose all your stuff. This
also adds to the crazy tenseness of the game. There's actually 24 hours on each
server, so if you play on one with your GMT offset, it'll be light when it's
light and dark when it's dark outside.

The biggest thing, though, is that this is a true sandbox: there are no
'levels' or 'experience points' or 'missions' or 'objectives.' You just play.
Average survival time is about 45 minutes, and as you live longer, the tension
goes way, way up. Because there are no missions, you develop a real attachment
to the 'emergent stories' that come out of the game, which is the big, big
draw for me. Here's an example:

I spawned just outside of Электрозаводск ('Electro'), and one of my roommates
had been playing for about twenty minutes, and was in Пута ("Puta"), just
north. He had found a barn with two hatchets in it, and obviously, as a new
player, that's a big deal. Электро and Пута are about [two kilometers away from
each other](http://dayzdb.com/map#4.099.124), so he decided to wait for me. I
ran up over that hill, and as I got closer, I didn't pay close enough
attention, and a zombie started chasing me. I decided to sprint to the barn,
so I'd at least be able to defend myself, and Kyle decided to brace himself:
my running would obviously draw more zombies, and the barn had three doors: we
couldn't cover them all. If we weren't careful, this could be the end.

As I sprint through the door, Kyle steps into it, and swings his hatchet. "Holy
shit dude, more coming, hurry up!" I quickly located the other one, as Kyle
took out the second undead trying to eat us. I stepped up too, and covered the
other door. Thirty seconds of frantic hatchet-ing later, we were safe. But Kyle
was starting to get thirsty, and Электро is really dangerous. We searched the
rest of the settlement, but no luck. No water to be found. We decided that
rather than risk the big costal town, it'd be best to [make the two klick
journey north to Могилевка](http://dayzdb.com/map#4.085.109). While trying to
locate the road, Kyle attracted the attention of another zombie, and after
dispatching it, found an empty watter bottle! Luckily, Пута has a public well,
so he could fill it and drink up. Problem solved.

Now, if this scenario had been a scripted part of some zombie RPG, I wouldn't
have cared about it at all. I've now told this story three times in person,
and it doesn't get old. This tense five minutes emerged naturally out of
putting players in the world and letting them go. As a result, since they're
_your_ stories, you care about them a lot more. People end up sharing these
stories, too: [Check out this Jeep theft on
YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oMdOPF8a8U). He spends the first 3
minutes or so telling the story.

## Ignoring video game tropes

So what really makes DayZ special? There are lots of sandbox games, and there
are lots of zombie games. Well, for me, it's that DayZ ignores much about
what makes for conventional games.

See, I've been playing video games for most of my life. I started with an NES
long ago, and spent many, many, many hours with various games across genres.
I play fewer games these days, and actually took a pretty big break from them
over the last two years or so. I would go to GameStop, look at what was
offered, shrug, and walk out. It's not that I'm growing up [(the average gamer
is 37)](http://www.theesa.com/facts/pdfs/ESA_EF_2011.pdf), it's that I've
played all these games before. I spent over a hundred hours with Diablo II, so
why bother with Diablo III?

When there's a game that breaks out of these standard genres and franchises,
I get excited. I really got into music games until Activision drove Guitar
Hero into the ground, Minecraft was incredibly addicting, and now DayZ with
its emergent gameplay, focus on realism, and tense atmosphere.

### Games need to be accessible

DayZ does not have mass appeal. Its uncompromising approach to realism means
that it will alienate many people. You will die often, and it will feel random
much of the time. You will get killed by other players. You'll break a bone
miles away from the nearest hospital with no morphine, and have to crawl for an
hour or die.

### Games should be polished

Frankly, [DayZ is buggy as shit](http://www.dayzwiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=Known_Bugs).
And not trivial ones, either:

> Dropping Items can cause them to disappear

Honestly, in many ways, it makes the game even more tense. Bad things can
happen to you at any time. The world is scary.

The interface sucks. This is more of an ARMAII issue, but one of my roommates
was trying to get something out of another roommate's backpack, and since you
both click to manipulate the UI and click to shoot, accidentally shot him in
the stomach. This totally could happen in a zombie apocalypse: fumble around
with the safety off... the interface can be confusing, seemingly arbitrary, and
complicated. Still totally worth it.

In many ways, this is the [worse is
better](http://www.jwz.org/doc/worse-is-better.html) principle.

### More is better

Many games are 'just like this other game, but with more stuff.' DayZ has a
really pleasant minimalism in many ways: the HUD is basically nonexistent,
the core gameplay is pretty simple, and while there are a lot of details, most
of them are not too complicated: break a leg, use some morphine. Hungry? Eat
some food.

But these simple components come together in a way that gives the game a large
amount of depth. But that depth is not from some big crazy feature that took
weeks to build.

In fact, the author of the mod has _removed_ entire features. There was a
'humanity' system at one time, and NPC 'bandits.' That's been taken out. I
didn't play the game with that particular feature in, but the author isn't
afraid to cut stuff out if it isn't a good idea, even if he's spent lots of
time building the feature.

### A good story matters

Most simulation games have some sort of goal. Even many 'sandbox' games, like
Grand Theft Auto, have some sort of points, goals, or missions, and you're
free to ignore them, but they're there. Minecraft is a great example of a
true sandbox game, and I'm not suggesting that DayZ has a monopoly here. But
it's a genre that doesn't have that many games in it, so another entry is very
welcome; the genre isn't as tired as many others.

Story is often used as a reason for progression; as you go through the story,
you get bigger, better, and generally more powerful. DayZ manages to have
progression without a story; there's sort of five broad stages to the game:
pre-hatchet, hatchet, gun, tent, PvP. This is hard to do! A story provides
nice justification. But DayZ doesn't need it.

Also, as I mentioned earlier, you sort of invent stories as you play. They
emerge. And therefore, you care about _your_ DayZ story more than the one that
would have been concocted if this game was not a sandbox.

### A player should be quite powerful

Often, the player is a total badass. Video games are often dripping in
machismo, and so they are **THE ULTIMATE DESTROYER OF WORLDS**. Maybe, after
killing hundreds of enemy soldiers, getting worn down over time, one gets a
lucky shot and you go down.

DayZ is different. You are weak. The environment is dangerous. Even though you
can kill zombies, often, the noise attracts others, and they get dangerous in
packs. And you can always run out of ammo...

Also, other players are just as desperate and dangerous as you are. Sometimes,
you'll be friendly, but more often, you're gonna end up getting shot. After
all, if you're not friendly, _I_ could get shot, so maybe I'd better take you
out first...

## DayZ is awesome

Seriously, you should give it a try. ARMAII goes on sale on Steam often, I was
able to pick it up for $17 the other day. If you're bored with the mainstream
of gaming, it just might be enough of a shake-up to be interesting to you.
