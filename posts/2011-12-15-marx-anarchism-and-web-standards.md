### An aside for software devs

You might not care about anarchism, and I can almost guarantee that you don't
care about Marx, but please bear with me. I think my point is best made by
putting the web stuff at the end, so please, just read it. ;) It'll be good
for you, I swear. I'll explain better at the end.

## Domain Specific Languages and information density

I've been noticing an effect lately that's certainly not new; it's just come up
frequently. When working within a domain that's new to them, most people tend
to not respect the density of the information being given to them, and it
causes them to draw incorrect inferences.

For example, this tweet earlier:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Does anybody else's head explode when they read an "unless" statement? What good is readability if comprehension goes out the window?</p>&mdash; Christopher Deutsch (@cdeutsch) <a href="https://twitter.com/twitterapi/status/147349882246676480" data-datetime="2011-12-15T11:18:00-05:00">December 15, 2011</a></blockquote>

And this response:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>@cdeutsch There are weirder idioms. @users.collect{|u| u.email} vs @users.collect(&:email) :) That should weird you out more.</p>&mdash; Brian P. Hogan (@bphogan) <a href="https://twitter.com/twitterapi/status/147359596602851328" data-datetime="2011-12-15T11:54:00-05:00">December 15, 2011</a></blockquote>

Now, I'm not saying that Christopher is in the wrong here, in fact, he agrees
with what I'm about to say:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>@philcrissman @bphogan I'm sure I'll get used to the "unless" pattern someday. But from a Ruby outsiders perspective it's hard to comprehend</p>&mdash; Christopher Deutsch (@cdeutsch) <a href="https://twitter.com/twitterapi/status/147358978404401152" data-datetime="2011-12-15T11:54:00-05:00">December 15, 2011</a></blockquote>

From someone new to Ruby, `Symbol#to_proc` or `unless` are hard to understand
initially, and that's because they've increased the density of information
being conveyed. `unless` is the same as `if not` and `&:foo` is the same as
`{|a| a.foo }`. Both of these constructs condense something more complicated
into something that is simpler, but denser.

You'll note that I said 'simpler,' but by a certain measure, `&:foo` is actually
more complex. When I say `&:foo` is simpler, I'm meaning for someone who's well
versed in Ruby, functional programming, or first-class functions. I have this exact
background, and so for me, `collection.map &:foo` is simpler and more readable
than `collection.map {|a| a.foo }`. When I read the first example, I say in my head
"Map foo over the collection." You have to grok what map really is to get that sentence
or the corresponding code. Whereas what (I imagine) someone who does not have this
kind of background thinks when they see the second example is "Okay, so map is
like an each, and for each thing in the collection, we're going to call foo on it."
This is a totally valid interpretation, but notice how much longer it is, and how much
more involved in the details it is. That's cool, but to someone who groks map, it
has a much larger amount of mental overhead, in the same way that my concise explanation
causes much more thinking for someone who doesn't grok it.

This happens often in education. DHH made [a comment](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3328427)
about this recently that illustrates this principle, and he couches it in terms of
"learnability" vs. "readability":

I think that 'learnability' is a pretty good shortening for 'light density' and
'usability' is decent for 'heavy density.' It's the same effect, though. For the
rest of this essay, I'll be using 'learnable' and 'usable' to mean this
particular usage.

Any time you encounter experts in a particular domain, they'll often have
fairly specific language that corresponds to that domain. This language is
usually designed to be usable, not learnable. This is because they've already done
the learning; learnability holds no utility for them. However, usability is
incredibly... useful. To them. They're working at a higher level of abstraction,
and don't want to get bogged down in details they already know well. Using
learnable language would cause them to take twice as long to say things; to
return to the density analogy, dense information is transferred from one person
to another more quickly. If you can read a sentence a second, but that sentence
is dense, you acquire much more information per second than if it was lighter.

This tendency means that most language that's specific to a domain will
generally trend towards the usable at the expense of the learnable. The impact
this has on individuals new to the domain, however, is that of a wall. An
impediment. Overcoming this obstacle requires a bit of good faith on the part
of the beginner; to cross quickly over the chasm between beginner and
expert, they must recognize and respect this aspect of the conversations they
will invariably become a part of. When faced with a term that is used in a
strange way, beginners should ask for clarification, and not start arguments
over semantics they don't yet even understand. Experts will recognize these
arguments as coming from a place where concepts are not yet fully understood,
and while they may recognize the need to help educate, if the newbie is being
belligerent, they may just ignore them instead. Nobody wins; the signal/noise
ratio has been decreased, the beginner doesn't learn, and everyone's time is
wasted.

Here's three other situations where I've seen this happen lately:

## Marx and the labor theory of value

Philosophy writing is generally a great example of text that is very much
usable, and not at all learnable. Some writers can still be learnable, but
most are not, in my experience. One of the reasons this happens is that they
introduce concepts early in a text and then utilize them later without
referring back to the earlier definition. This isn't a problem for anyone
who's thinking about taking off the training wheels or anyone who reads the
entire text. The danger comes in when someone _not_ versed in the entire text
attempts to take portions of it out of its context.

Consider Marx, and _Capital_. The meaning of 'value' is a central concern
of his writing, and indeed, entire critique of the political economy. It's
so important that the first few chapters are devoted to an (excruciatingly,
frankly) detailed explanation of his thoughts on the true meaning of value.
The rest of _Capital_ is built on top of this: at least in my understanding of
Marx, it all boils back down to that one question. And when having discussions
between people who are devotees of Marx and those who come from other schools
of economics, this kind of language gets in the way.

It also causes ideas to be misrepresented: the first time I was ever introduced
to the labor theory of value, it was by a close friend who's very libertarian.
This was a few years ago, so it's an obvious paraphrase, but he summarized
it thusly: "Yeah, I mean, the labor theory of value basically says that people
should be paid for however much work they put into things, so if I take six
hours to make a widget and you take four, the price of a widget from you should
be six yet mine should only be four, and ideas like 'market value' should be
disregarded. It's totally irrelevant if I suck at making widgets, I should get
paid more than you anyway." Which, to put it lightly, is a misrepresentation.
While explaining the labor theory of value is outside of the scope of this
post, what I will say is that to Marx, 'value' is something intrinsic to an
object; it's the 'socially necessary abstract labor' inherent to it. Talk about
dense language! What a capitalist would call 'value,' a Marxist would call
'price.'

As you can see, even just one little word, 'value,' can be quite dense! Can
you imagine a discussion intended to be 'learnable' to outsiders about what's
meant? Imagine the expansion: 'value' -> 'socially necessary abstract
labor' -> ... Marx is already long enough; Capital would be thousands of pages!
Yet to a beginner who flips to Chapter 12, they'll read a sentence that contains
'value' and draw poor conclusions! They wouldn't even realize they're making a
mistake, I mean, how could five letters be misinterpreted?

Furthermore, people who haven't read Marx don't generally draw distinctions
between his critique of capitalism and his solution: communism. This is annoying
when trying to explain to people that I love his critique, but am critical
of his answers to its problems; they perceive this weakness in his answer
as a weakness in his description of the problem. Furthermore, they then say
"but I thought you call yourself a communist?" and I respond with "sure; the
issues I have are with the dictatorship of the proletariat, not with the
general idea of communism" and then their eyes glaze over and they change
the subject. Information density claims another victim...

Oh, and a great example of Marxist economics in a usable form [is here](http://people.wku.edu/jan.garrett/303/marxecon.htm).

## Anarchism and 'anarcho'-capitalists

Arguments often boil down to these kinds of questions of definition, but one
place where I see it happen almost _constantly_ is amongst anarchists. I mean,
from the outset, anarchists have to battle against the general definition of
'chaos and disorder' versus the domain-specific 'without rulers.' Within that,
'rulers' in anarchism is fraught with the same sort of questions that 'value'
has for Marx. The prime example of this are the terribly misguided
'anarcho'-capitalists, better described as 'voluntaryists.'

Here's the deal: ancaps lack an understanding of the vast majority of historical
anarchist thought, and so try to appropriate the term 'anarchism' to describe
their philosophy which is decidedly not anarchist. The ones who do have started
using 'voluntaryist' to describe themselves, which is a great example of using
information density to mislead, but that's a whole separate rant. Here's the
411, from [the Anarchist FAQ](http://infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionF1),
which has its own things to say about density when it comes to the language
specific to political theory discussions:

> "Anarcho"-capitalists claim to be anarchists because they say that they oppose
> government. As noted in the last section, they use a dictionary definition of
> anarchism. However, this fails to appreciate that anarchism is a political
> theory. As dictionaries are rarely politically sophisticated things, this means
> that they fail to recognise that anarchism is more than just opposition to
> government, it is also marked a opposition to capitalism (i.e. exploitation and
> private property). Thus, opposition to government is a necessary but not
> sufficient condition for being an anarchist -- you also need to be opposed to
> exploitation and capitalist private property. As "anarcho"-capitalists do not
> consider interest, rent and profits (i.e. capitalism) to be exploitative nor
> oppose capitalist property rights, they are not anarchists.

Part of the problem with the second half of this quote is that I'm such an
'expert' on this kind of language that I don't even know if it'll make sense to
you; without the kind of background reading in socialist political philosophies,
it might just be gibberish. At least, the first paragraph should be pretty
straightforward, and you can take the second as an example of this kind of
language.

Giving you a short explanation of why anarchists are against Capitalism is a
great example in and of itself of domain specific language and density. Here:

> Property is theft.

This is a quote by [Proudhon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon),
the first person to call himself an anarchist. Let's unpack the first few layers
of this statement:

Property. Here's [Wikipedia's explanation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property):

> Private property is the right of persons and firms to obtain, own, control,
> employ, dispose of, and bequeath land, capital, and other forms of property.
> Private property is distinguishable from public property, which refers to
> assets owned by a state, community or government rather than by individuals or
> a business entity. Private property emerged as the dominant form of property
> in the means of production and land during the Industrial Revolution in the
> early 18th century, displacing feudal property, guilds, cottage industry and
> craft production, which were based on ownership of the tools for production by
> individual laborers or guilds of craftspeople.
>
> Marxists and socialists distinguish between "private property" and "personal
> property", defining the former as the means of production in reference to
> private enterprise based on socialized production and wage labor; and the
> latter as consumer goods or goods produced by an individual.

Whew! There's a few things to note here: Captialists like to pretend that capitalism
is synonymous with 'trade,' and not something that started in the 1800s. Likewise,
that private property rights are something that has always existed. However,
as this alludes to, there are many different kinds of property rights that have
existed at different places and times.

So in 'property is theft,' Proudhon is referring to private ownership of the
'means of production.' Let's expand that. Again, [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Means_of_production):

> Means of production refers to physical, non-human inputs used in production—the
> factories, machines, and tools used to produce wealth — along with both
> infrastructural capital and natural capital. This includes the classical
> factors of production minus financial capital and minus human capital. They
> include two broad categories of objects: instruments of labour (tools,
> factories, infrastructure, etc.) and subjects of labour (natural resources and
> raw materials). People operate on the subjects of labour, using the instruments
> of labour, to create a product; or, stated another way, labour acting on the
> means of production creates a product. When used in the broad sense, the
> "means of production" includes the "means of distribution" which includes
> stores, banks, and railroads. The term can be simply and picturesquely
> described in an agrarian society as the soil and the shovel; in an industrial
> society, the mines and the factories.

We could continue to discuss how to distinguish between this 'private property'
and 'possessions,' which anarchists are _not_ against, but I'm just trying to
demonstrate that this word 'property' is incredibly complex.

Okay, so Proudhon claims that 'owning the physical inputs used in factories used
to produce wealth is theft.' I could expand on 'theft,' but really, I think my
point about density is made.  For more on this, see
[Why are anarchists against private property?](http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/secB3.html).

## Web standards

Web standards are another great example of a domain that has a lot of very specific
language. And one that people often think they can grab random chunks out of and
quote without fully understanding the rest of the context.

This is going on right now [with Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/505).
There's a discussion about if the `PATCH` HTTP verb should get support, and if it
should be the verb that matches to the `update` action or not. It's ended up
in a discussion about the semantics of `PUT`, which has resulted in a lot of
random quoting of standards documents by myself and others. Here's some running
commentary on some of the comments. It's impossible to do this without it becoming
semi-personal, so let me just say upfront that I think everyone is participating
honestly in this discussion, but I think it's a great example of people who aren't
familiar with a domain jumping in and drawing incorrect conclusions.

First up, benatkin comments:

> I googled for HTTP verbs and clicked the first result and PATCH isn't listed.
>
> http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html
>
> Where is it?

Anyone participating in a discussion about `PATCH` should be reasonably familiar
with `PATCH`. Learning where `PATCH` is defined is as simple as [Googling HTTP PATCH](https://www.google.com/#hl=en&q=http+patch),
which shows it being defined in [RFC 5879](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789).
With that said, this is a good example of asking for clarification, and not
immediately progressing into an argumentatitive "It's not in HTTP 1.1, so it's
bullshit!" style of learning where `PATCH` is being defined.

Of course, the thread starts to dissolve later, when @stevegraham mentions:

> i must be the only person in the world that disagrees with "PUT requires a
> complete replacement", as per RFC2616 "HTTP/1.1 does not define how a PUT
> method affects the state of an origin server"

Now, Steve is an awesome guy, but he's a bit misguided in this case. This is
a great example of drawing an incorrect conclusion based on one sentence out
of context. He's not _wrong_ in a strict sense, [RFC2616](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt)
does contain that line. However, this is because [HTTP defines the semantics of communication](http://www.imc.org/atom-protocol/mail-archive/msg05425.html),
and the semantics are 'idempotent creation or replacement.' The fact that
HTTP does not define how PUT affects state is irrelevant, an entire representation
is needed for idempotency reasons. [PUT's definition](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.6)
also says pretty clearly:

> The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied
> Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to an already existing resource, the
> enclosed entity SHOULD be considered as a modified version of the one residing
> on the origin server. If the Request-URI does not point to an existing
> resource, and that URI is capable of being defined as a new resource by the
> requesting user agent, the origin server can create the resource with that URI.

"The enclosed entity be stored" is pretty straightforward: it needs an entity,
not a portion of an entity. Furthermore, how is a server going to create a
resource without a complete representation if the resource didn't already exist?

In this case, the standard's organization also doesn't help: if you just read
the section titled `PUT`, you wouldn't get the full understanding, since the fact
that it's safe and idempotent is mentioned above in the section regarding those
two things. I'm not sure why those aspects aren't in each definition, and are
in a different section above, but the point is that you need to consider the
full document in its entirety to understand the semantics of `PUT`. Steve is
only reading one section and then extrapolating from there.

There's a lot more in that pull request, but one more example: Konstantin points
out that Rails supports a lot of things that aren't standards:

> You mean Rails should not support proposed standards like, say, Cookies?

Yep. Did you know that? Cookies aren't actually a standard, just a proposed one.

Anyway, I also want to say this: I am not a perfect interpreter of these things
either. I often change my opinions after learning more things, and I think this
is a good thing. There's nothing the matter with being wrong; it's how you handle
it that matters. The discussion in this thread continues. RFCs are also not
perfect, and do have wiggle-room; but it's important that agreements are followed.
Amongst people who discuss REST and HTTP, the fact that PUT requires a full
representation is not controversial; it's simply understood as true.

## It's good for you!

I don't want to turn anyone off from learning new things; exploring new domains
is a great path towards personal growth. I've said a few times that I think
more programmers should read Marx, and it's because I think this experience of
jumping into the deep end of a new set of language that you don't fully
understand is a tremendous educational experience. But to truly learn, an open
mind and open ears are crucial. Making arguments on semantics doesn't work if
you don't understand the context and semantics of words, as words change
significantly when placed in different surroundings.
