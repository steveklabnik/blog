I always enjoy reading [patio11's year in review
posts](http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/12/29/bingo-card-creator-and-other-stuff-year-in-review-2012/),
and while I didn't take enough notes for this year to do a GOOD one, I figure
that I should at least leave some notes so that when I do one next year, I'll
have something to benchmark against.

## Ruby

This has been a whirlwind year for my career. My work with Jumpstart Lab is
incredibly fulfilling, and makes sure my bills get paid.

* I flew all over the world. I've always wanted to travel, and while I complain
  about it a lot, it's truly wonderful to be able to go places. I now have the
  second highest Delta frequent flyer tier memebership. If you'd told me that
  three years ago, I'd have laughed at you.
* I spoke at a _lot_ of conferences, and gave my first keynote. More lined up
  for next year already. Speaking is something I love to do.
* Teaching classes has been fantastic, and I'd love to do even more of it next
  year.
* I now have commit access to Rails. I put in a lot of work over the last few
  months, and this means a lot to me. Last step: core. We'll see if I ever get
  there.
* I now have 22 gems, with Draper being my largest project, at almost 200,000
  downloads.

Unrelated to Ruby, I was able to contribute to a wide variety of projects in
a few languages this year, and now have [116 repos on
GitHub](http://github.com/steveklabnik). A lot of those are abandoned or old,
but still, they're all something I was doing _something_ with this year.

## Writing

I finally made the [hypermedia book](http://designinghypermediaapis.com/)
become a reality, and it's done really well.  Many people have told me that it
has opened their eyes to a new way of doing things, and a bunch of startups
have told me they'll be releasing hypermedia APIs in 2013. Sales have been
brisk: I don't want to disclose exact numbers, but I will tell you that it's in
the 5 figure range. This has allowed me to start taking chunks out of my
student loans: once they're paid off, I will be super lean financially.

I made it to the Svbtle blog network, which is invite-only. I've gotten mostly
good feedback about everything I've done there, which is pleasing.

I started [a book to learn Rust programming](http://www.rustforrubyists.com/)
last week, as a way of helping myself learn Rust, making some more money, and
testing out a publishing workflow that might influence the next iteration of
Designing Hypermedia APIs. I like it a lot.

## Reading

I read a lot, though not as much as I'd like. I want to read 30 books this next
year, and finally got into the habit of using GoodReads.

## Etc

I had a really good year in other regards: fulfilling relationships, fun times,
good food... not everything was spectacular, but overall, really good. I moved
out of my hometown, finally, and that's been really great. I'm back now for
the holidays, and it feels so small...

The only really bad thing was the death of my father. That still has
interesting effects on my life, but mostly in non-obvious ways. That's all I'll
say about that.
